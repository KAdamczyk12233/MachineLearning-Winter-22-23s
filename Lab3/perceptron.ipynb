    "Then, the goal is to minimize that distance with respect to all training instances and feature-label pairs. The combination of all distances together is called a `loss function`. This is a very important concept as different optimization problems can have different loss functions. For example, a common loss function for regression is `mean squared error`:\n",

    "Gradient Descent Algorithm iteratively calculates the next point using gradient at the current position, scales it (by a learning rate) and subtracts obtained value from the current position (makes a step). It subtracts the value because we want to minimise the function (to maximise it would be adding). This process can be written as:\n",
